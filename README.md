# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

I know that this is the most simple project ever but it was the very first one I made and I leave it here to remind myself how far I've come.

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my very first attempt at building someone on my own, so even though it's very simple, it was my first project.

### Continued development

In the future I want to focus more on mobile first design as I learned the pitfalls of ignoring this philosophy.
